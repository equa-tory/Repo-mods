When you die, you speak from your head. You watch your head. Your friends find the head in a dark corner, crying for help, begging to be taken back into the light. Press space or click to go back to classic spectating.

Future update plans: Add a confirmation message on screen for vacating the head. Slight blue glow to indicate an inhabited head. Light up brighter in time with speech.

Known issues: no text-to-speech (DeadTTS might work with this? Haven't tried yet...), bit of clipping.
