Adds a custom model version of the duck to the game.

doesnt replace the duck, just adds as its own monster, if you want to have just this instead of the duck, I reccomend adding the "Enemy and Valuable Spawn Manager" mod By soundedsquash

already has its own sound effects, no complementry mod needed.

thank you to Zehs / CritHaxXoG for trying to help me with C#, even tho im a big dummy with it.

if anyone wants the model or sounds i made msg me and i can send em.
