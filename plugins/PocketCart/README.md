# PocketCart Plus

### Improve the Pocket Cart with a new upgrade that can store items! Buy a larger pocket cart variant!  

This mod is intended for use by **all clients** in a lobby. This mod provides **one** upgrade and **one** item that can be purchased in the shop that will enhance the pocket cart.  

### Features:

**UPGRADE: Pocket C.A.R.T. Upgrade - Keep Items**  
	- When the pocket cart is stored, will store any items in the cart alongside it.  
	- Configurable to be a shared upgrade or by individual.  
**ITEM: Pocket C.A.R.T. PLUS**  
	- This is a separate pocket cart item that has been recolored and will provide a slight size increase.
    - The base size increase is 125% of a standard pocket cart, with potential rare size increases of 150-175%.
    - The rare size increases do not persist between levels so use them while you got them!
